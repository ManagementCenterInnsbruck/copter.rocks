 *
 * The LARIX Flight-Controller is the Flight-Controller software for the LARIX Quadrocopter Demonstrator.<br> 
 * Built on top the DAVE4 Apps and XMC library it provides an easy to configure solution which can be easily modified.<br>
 * 
 *
 * @section support Supported devices and toolchains
 * The following 32-Bit Industrial Microcontrollers based on ARM Cortex-M4F are supported:
 * - XMC4500 series
 *
 * The following tool chains are supported:
 * - GNU GCC for ARM (gcc) found in DAVE4.
 *
 * @section overview Overview
  * Main function of this piece of software is to collect the data of the user input:
 * - Bluetooth (RN42) or
 * - RC-Receiver (DSMX-Spektrum) <br>
 *
 * and the internal sensors:
 * - MPU9X50 (Inertial Measurement Unit)
 * - DPS310  (Precision pressure sensor)
 *
 * to calculate and transmit needed speed of motors so that a stable flight is ensured.
 * <br>
 *
 * The LARIX-Flight Controller Software consists of several files all stored at the _Quadrocopter folder. <br>
 * Within this _Quadrocopter folder you find several subfolders, which represent nearly independent modules <br>
 * that are built on top of DAVE4 Apps, the XMC Library and a rudimentary Harware Abstraction Layer. <br>
 *
 * The software is interrupt driven which means every sensor and the control interrupt is caused by <br>
 * it's individual interrupt source which could be a timer or an external interrupt that is triggered by the <br>
 * sensor itself. Detailed information for each Interrupt and the corresponding service routine can be found at the<br>
 * end of this document.
 * <br>
 *
 * A debug interface is given via uC Probe: <a href="http://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/microcontroller/development-tools-software-and-kits/dave-version-4-free-development-platform-for-code-generation/uc-probe-xmc-for-industrial-mcu/channel.html?channel=5546d46254e133b40154f34038fe1620#ispnTab1">uC Probe</a> <br>
 * or via a VCOM Port provided by a USB interface which is configured and used via USB_VCOM App.

 *
 * - _FIR_Filter<br>
 * This module provides a simple implementation of a finite impulse response filter. <br>
 * It is used for filtering the pressure data provided by the DPS310.
 
 * - _HAL<br>
 * This module builds the basis for serial communication via<br> 
 * UART and I2C and holds the files for a delay function.<br>
 * In addition it contains the file GPIO.h which provides an easy way to control<br> 
 * the digital pins of the controller.
 * 
 * - Attitude_Control<br>
 * This module holds the control algorithms for the Quadrocopter.<br>
 * In addition it contains the function for scaling the output values of the control algorithm to the input values of the electric speed controllers(ESC's).<br> 
 * 
 *
 * - BatterySafety<br>
 * This module contains the software for battery monitoring.<br>
 * It shows battery status via three status LED's that are mounted at<br>
 * the LARIX board.
 *
 * - DaisyChain<br>
 * This module provides functions to transmit data using an UART DaisyChain which connects the flight controller<br>
 * with the ESC's.
 * The possibility to add feedback data from the ESC's is given, but is not implemented.
 *
 * - RemoteControl<br>
 * This module contains the software for receiving the steering data of the user.<br>
 * The two supported ways of communication are Bluetooth(RN-42 module)<br>
 * and 2.4GHz Radio(Spektrum DSMX Receiver, Spektrum DX6i transmitter).<br>
 * A Bluetooth-Only mode can be configured via a #define at the  RCReceive.h
 *
 * - Sensors<br>
 * This module contains the software for configuring, reading and interpreting the<br>
 * values of both the DPS310 pressure sensor and the MPU9X50 Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU). Both are signaling new values<br>
 * by triggering external interrupts.
 * 
 *
 *
 * @section interrupts Interrupts at LARIX Flight-Controller software
 *
 * Like described at the section overview the LARIX Flight-Controller software<br>
 * is an interrupt driven software. This means a set of functions exists, which are executed when<br> a specific event triggers an interrupt.<br>
 * It is important to know that these functions can be interrupted by each other depending on their<br>
 * priority. Priority 0 is the highest priority while 63 is the last priority that can be given<br>
 * to an interrupt function.<br>
 * At Dave4 Interrupts are handled via INTERRUPT App.<br>
 *
 * LARIX Flight-Controller software uses global variables to communicate with other interrupt routines.<br>
 * It is important to note that every variable, which is used by more than one interrupt is only allowed to be directly<br>
 * manipulated by one interrupt. Every other interrupt which wants to use the data stored at these globals<br>
 * has to make a local copy of the global one. This is done to avoid unwanted change of global variables<br>
 * which would influence stability of the other software modules.
 *
 *The next table shows all independent interrupt routines and their purpose. <br>
